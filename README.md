# Classification of 2D gestures using Hidden Markov Models and Support Vector Machines

Final project for MIT's 6.867 Machine Learning (Fall 2012)

In my final project for 6.867 Machine Learning I present a method for classifying two dimensional gestures using two different methods (HMMs and SVMs). I describe the type of gestures under consideration and detail the experimental setup that I used to capture the gestures. Then I provide a method to extract features from the recorded two dimensional gestures that is suitable for classification tasks. Next I describe a method for gesture classification that achieves accuracy rates of 96.81% (for test examples of trained gestures) and 96.2% (for test examples of trained gestures, non-trained gestures and random sequences). Similarly, I provide a classification method using SVMs that achieves rates of 94.2% and 93.8% under the same conditions. Finally, I conclude summarizing my findings and comparing both methods for this task.

This project requires the [HMM Toolbox for Matlab](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html). The SVM classification is done using [LibSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).
